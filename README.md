# SpringMVCFilmCRUD
The user is presented with a home page. From there they are given two options, an option to find a film by id and keyword and to create a film. When they click on the link to search for films, they are directed to a page where they can do so. When they click on the link to create a Film, they are presented with three txt boxes to fill out the new title, description and release year.

# Description
We are retrieving data from a database using queries within our implementation class.Our controller methods are taking in the data as parameters. We are then storing that data within film objects created within the methods. We then passed the specific set of parameters sent in to the controllers, to the jsp files and used a RequestParam annotation to link specifc parameters to a certain form within the jsp file. From there the user is able to output and input information while using the webpages.
